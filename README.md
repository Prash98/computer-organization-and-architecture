# Computer Organization and Architecture

[![N|Solid](https://cldup.com/dTxpPi9lDf.thumb.png)](https://nodesource.com/products/nsolid)

This repository holds all the code I shall write for my course CSE381 on Computer Organization and Architecture. It is all in MIPS assembly. The objective of this course is to feel more at home to lower computer level code. This repository also holds the cheatsheets the author used to code as well as register information pretaining to all the registers in use.

  - MIPS cheatsheet
  - Detail on QtSpim

### Installation

MIPS assembly requires  [QtSpim](http://spimsimulator.sourceforge.net/) or other simulators to run. The author has maintained QtSpim for all testing and debugging.

###  Cheatsheets

### Development
Want to contribute? Great! If you have any cool MIPS code that you want to share, be my guest.
